# Birthday Gift AI Agent – Minimal Build Spec

## Overview

A simple gifting automation agent.

Users add birthdays of people they care about — along with their name, address, and a gift selected from a mock store. The agent automatically sends that gift on their birthday using Payman's test wallet (TSD). Delivery is simulated, and all gift history is logged.

No AI gift selection — the user chooses the gift in advance.
No manual approval — the agent handles payments and shipping automatically on the scheduled day.

## Core Flow

1. **User logs in via Supabase Auth**
2. **User adds a contact**: name, birthday, address, and selected gift
3. **System stores gift and recipient info**
4. **Agent runs daily**:

   * Checks for birthdays today
   * If found, triggers payment via Payman
   * Simulates delivery (shipped → delivered)
5. **All transactions are stored and viewable in history**

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: React + Tailwind + Vite
* **Auth**: Supabase Auth
* **Backend**: Node.js (Express or serverless)
* **Database**: Supabase DB (Postgres)
* **Scheduler**: cron job (Vercel Cron or node-cron)
* **Payments**: Payman SDK (test mode / TSD)
* **Mock Store**: JSON of gift items with name, image, price

The user stores who, when, and what to gift — and the AI agent makes it happen automatically on the birthday using Payman test payments.

Clean. Private. No decisions made by AI. Just remember and act.

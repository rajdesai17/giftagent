Rules for Building and Maintaining

**Clarity and Brevity**
   - Write in clear, concise language. Avoid jargon unless it is explained.
   - Use bullet points, tables, and code blocks for readability.
   - Keep sections minimal but informativeâ€”do not overload with unnecessary details.
**Official Documentation Links**
   - When referencing external tools, SDKs, or APIs (e.g., Payman, Gemini, Vercel), always include a link to the official documentation. - https://docs.paymanai.com/overview/quickstart
**Error Handling and Troubleshooting**
   - If the answer is not found, consult the official documentation for the relevant tool or library.
   - Document common errors and their solutions in a dedicated FAQ or Troubleshooting section if needed.
